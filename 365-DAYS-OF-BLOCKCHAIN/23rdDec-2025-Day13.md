# DAY–13 — Bridges & Cross-Chain: Where Web3 Breaks Most Often

## Gist

Blockchains are like separate islands.  
Bridges promise to connect them.  
But most of the biggest hacks in Web3 happened **on bridges**.

Not because blockchains are weak —  
but because **bridges sit at the edges**.

# What Are Blockchain Bridges?

### _How Value Moves Between Separate Blockchains_

---

## Why Bridges Are Needed

Each blockchain is its **own system**:

- Ethereum has its own state
- Solana has its own state
- Bitcoin has its own state

Ethereum **cannot know** what happened on Solana.  
There is no shared memory.

So a simple question becomes hard:

> “How do I use my Ethereum assets on another chain?”

That’s the problem bridges try to solve.

---

## What a Bridge Actually Does

A bridge does **not** move assets directly.

Instead, it follows this pattern:

1. You **lock** your asset on Chain A
2. The bridge **verifies** this lock
3. A **representation** of that asset is created on Chain B
4. You use that representation on Chain B

When you come back:

- the representation is burned
- the original asset is unlocked

So value moves,  
but the original asset **never leaves its chain**.

## A Simple Mental Model

Think of a bridge like a **cloakroom system**:

- You give your jacket to Counter A
- They give you a claim ticket
- You use the ticket elsewhere
- When you return the ticket, you get your jacket back

The jacket never traveled.  
Only the **claim** did.

---

## How Bridges Know What Happened

This is where things get dangerous.

Bridges rely on **verification mechanisms**, such as:

- multisignature wallets
- validator sets
- relayers
- oracles
- light clients (rare and complex)

These components must answer:

> “Did this transaction really happen on the other chain?”

If this verification is wrong —
**fake assets can be minted or real assets can be stolen**.

---

## Why Bridges Are Risky

Bridges are risky because:

- they sit **outside** core blockchain security
- they rely on extra assumptions
- they often have smaller validator sets
- one bug can unlock or mint unlimited funds

Most bridge hacks happened because:

- verification logic failed
- keys were compromised
- trust assumptions were broken

Not because cryptography failed.

---

## The Big Insight

> **Blockchains are strong internally.  
> Bridges are external systems.**

Security drops the moment you step outside the base chain.

That’s why:

- bridges are the #1 attack surface in Web3
- billions were lost through bridge exploits

---

## Why Bridges Still Exist

Despite the risks, bridges are necessary:

- users want liquidity everywhere
- applications want interoperability
- ecosystems want growth

The space is evolving:

- better designs
- fewer trust assumptions
- rollup-native bridges
- shared security models

But the problem is **not fully solved yet**.

---

## Final Note

You now understand:

- what bridges are,
- why they exist,
- and why they fail so often.

Bridges are powerful —  
but they demand **extra caution**.

**Now the ocean is yours.  
Dive in.**

## What Really Matters

- **Blockchains don’t naturally talk to each other**

  - Ethereum doesn’t know what happened on Solana
  - Bitcoin doesn’t know what happened on Ethereum
  - Each chain lives in its own reality

- **Bridges act as translators**

  - Lock assets on Chain A
  - Mint representations on Chain B
  - Move value without moving the original asset

- **Bridges introduce trust**

  - Validators, multisigs, relayers, oracles
  - More logic = more assumptions
  - More assumptions = more attack surface

- **Most major Web3 hacks were bridge failures**

  - Wormhole
  - Ronin Bridge
  - Nomad
  - Billions lost — not from broken cryptography,
    but from broken design and trust assumptions

- **Why bridges are hard to secure**
  - They must verify _another chain’s truth_
  - They often rely on small validator sets
  - One mistake = unlimited minting or draining

---

## The Insight

> **Blockchains are strong at the core.  
> They fail at the edges.**

Bridges are edges.

---

## Final Note

You now know **where Web3 is most fragile**.

If you want safety:

- understand assumptions,
- minimize trust,
- respect complexity.

The designs are evolving.  
The research is active.

**Now the ocean is yours.  
Dive in.**
