# DAY 31 — Blobs: Temporary Data with Permanent Trust  
### *How Ethereum Scaled Data Availability Without Breaking Itself*

---

## Gist
Ethereum didn’t invent blobs to be fancy.  
It invented blobs because **calldata was the wrong tool**.

Blobs exist to do one job only:
> **Make data available when it matters — and disappear when it doesn’t.**

---

## Recap the Logical Pressure (No Skipping)

By DAY 30, we know:

- Rollups need data to be **available**
- Ethereum doesn’t need that data **forever**
- Calldata forces permanent storage
- Permanent storage hurts decentralization

So the requirement became unavoidable:

> **High-throughput, low-cost, temporary data — enforced by consensus.**

This requirement is what blobs satisfy.

---

## What a Blob Actually Is (First Principles)

A blob is:
- a chunk of data
- attached to a block
- guaranteed to be available
- **not accessible to the EVM**
- **not stored forever**

Important:
> Blobs are *not* state.  
> Blobs are *not* calldata.  
> Blobs are *not* execution inputs.

They exist purely for **Data Availability**.

---

## Why Blobs Are Invisible to Smart Contracts

This is intentional.

If contracts could read blobs:
- they would become execution inputs
- they would affect state
- they would need permanent storage

Ethereum forbids this.

Blobs are:
- for rollups
- for verifiers
- for observers

Not for contracts.

---

## How Blobs Enforce Data Availability

When a blob is included:
- validators attest to its availability
- nodes download it
- the network confirms it existed

Anyone can:
- retrieve the blob
- reconstruct rollup state
- generate fraud proofs
- verify validity proofs

That’s enough.

After the challenge window:
- blobs can be pruned
- storage pressure disappears

Trust remains.

---

## Why Blobs Are Cheaper Than Calldata

Because blobs:
- are not executed
- are not stored forever
- are not part of state
- do not affect EVM computation

They are priced separately.

Ethereum says:
> “If you only want availability,  
you shouldn’t pay execution prices.”

This is architectural honesty.

---

## What Blobs Change for Rollups

With blobs:
- rollups post more data
- fees drop significantly
- throughput increases
- L1 stays lightweight

Ethereum becomes:
- a DA layer
- a settlement layer
- a verifier

Not a global computer.

---

## What Blobs Do *Not* Solve

Blobs do NOT:
- execute transactions
- reduce L1 block time
- remove MEV
- make Ethereum fast by itself

They solve **exactly one bottleneck**.

And that precision is why they work.

---

## The Deeper Insight (Lock This)

> **Ethereum didn’t scale by doing more.  
It scaled by doing less — but doing it correctly.**

Execution moved away.  
Data stayed — temporarily.

---

## The Analogy (Final Lock)

### Ethereum Is a University Exam System

- Final grades → stored permanently
- Answer sheets → kept until re-evaluation ends

Rollup data is the answer sheet.

You don’t need it forever.
You need it:
- during verification
- during disputes
- during appeals

Blobs are **answer sheets with an expiry date**.

---

## Final Note

You’ve now crossed a threshold.

You understand:
- why DA comes first
- why calldata failed
- why blobs exist
- why rollups suddenly became cheap

Tomorrow, one final step remains:

> **If data is temporary,  
how do we make sure it was *really* available?**

That question leads to **Data Availability Sampling**  
and finally to **sharding**.

**Now the ocean is yours.  
Dive in.**
