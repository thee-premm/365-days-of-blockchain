# DAY–21 — How Layer-2s Fail

### _Where Scaling Assumptions Break_

---

## Gist

Layer-2s don’t usually fail because of bad math.  
They fail because of **assumptions**.

When those assumptions break,  
users discover what they were really trusting.

---

## Failure Mode 1: Centralized Sequencers

Most Layer-2s rely on a **sequencer** to order transactions.

If the sequencer:

- goes offline,
- censors transactions,
- or acts maliciously,

then:

- users can’t transact normally,
- withdrawals may be delayed,
- trust is temporarily broken.

This is not a bug — it’s a **known trade-off**.

---

## Failure Mode 2: Broken Fraud Proofs (Optimistic Rollups)

Optimistic rollups assume:

> “Someone honest will challenge bad state.”

Failures happen if:

- fraud proofs are buggy,
- challenge mechanisms are incomplete,
- no one is incentivized to challenge.

If fraud goes unchallenged:

- invalid state becomes final,
- Ethereum accepts the wrong result.

Security depends on **watchers actually watching**.

---

## Failure Mode 3: Exit & Withdrawal Risks

Layer-2s promise:

> “You can always exit to Layer-1.”

In practice:

- exits may take days,
- users may need technical knowledge,
- bridges may be required.

If users don’t understand exits:

- panic happens,
- trust erodes,
- confidence drops.

Safety exists — but only if users know how to use it.

---

## Failure Mode 4: Upgrade Keys & Governance Control

Many Layer-2s are still evolving.

This means:

- contracts may be upgradeable,
- teams may hold admin keys,
- emergency controls may exist.

If misused or compromised:

- rules can change suddenly,
- users may be exposed.

Decentralization is often **a roadmap, not a present state**.

---

## Failure Mode 5: Dependency on Ethereum Liveness

Layer-2s inherit Ethereum’s security —
but also its availability.

If Ethereum:

- becomes congested,
- spikes in gas,
- or slows finality,

Layer-2 operations:

- slow down,
- become expensive,
- or stall temporarily.

Layer-2s are not independent systems.

---

## Failure Mode 6: User Misunderstanding (Most Common)

The biggest failure isn’t technical.

It’s when users:

- assume Layer-2s are Layer-1s,
- don’t understand trust assumptions,
- ignore documentation.

When something goes wrong:

- users feel “betrayed”
- even though the system behaved as designed.

---

## The Real Insight

> **Layer-2s don’t remove trust.  
> They move it — and narrow it.**

Understanding _where_ trust lives matters.

---

## Final Note

Layer-2s are not failures.  
They are **carefully balanced compromises**.

They trade:

- speed for assumptions,
- cost for complexity,
- simplicity for scalability.

If you know the assumptions,
you can use them safely.

**Now the ocean is yours.  
Dive in.**
