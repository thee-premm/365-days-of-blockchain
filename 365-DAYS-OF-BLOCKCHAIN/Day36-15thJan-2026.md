# DAY 36 — Security vs Safety vs Trust

### _Three Words Everyone Uses, Few Understand_

---

## Gist

Security, safety, and trust are not the same thing.

Confusing them leads to:

- false confidence,
- bad design,
- and painful losses.

Understanding the difference changes how you judge every system.

---

## Start From Absolute Zero

Let’s strip emotions and marketing.

We define each term by **what question it answers**.

---

## 1️⃣ Security — “Can the Rules Be Broken?”

**Security** answers:

> _Can someone violate the system’s rules?_

A system is secure if:

- attackers cannot break cryptography,
- consensus rules cannot be bypassed,
- invariants cannot be violated.

Security is about **correctness under attack**.

Important:

- Security is technical
- Security is objective
- Security does not care about outcomes

A system can be perfectly secure  
and still cause massive losses.

---

## 2️⃣ Safety — “Can This Hurt Me?”

**Safety** answers:

> _Even if the system works as designed, can users get harmed?_

Safety is about:

- UX traps,
- foot-guns,
- irreversible mistakes,
- economic cliffs.

Examples:

- signing the wrong transaction,
- approving unlimited token access,
- interacting with complex DeFi strategies.

A system can be secure  
but unsafe for humans.

---

## 3️⃣ Trust — “Who Must Behave Honestly?”

**Trust** answers:

> _Who do I rely on for this to work correctly?_

Trust exists when:

- humans control upgrades,
- admins can pause contracts,
- multisigs hold power,
- oracles provide inputs,
- sequencers order transactions.

Trust is about **assumptions**, not bugs.

A trusted system can be:

- safe,
- or unsafe,
- secure,
- or insecure.

They are orthogonal.

---

## Why People Confuse These Three

Because in traditional systems:

- security,
- safety,
- and trust

are bundled together under institutions.

Web3 **separates them**.

This separation is powerful — and dangerous if misunderstood.

---

## The Crucial Matrix (Think This Way)

| Property | Question             | Failure Looks Like    |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Security | Can rules be broken? | Hacks, exploits       |
| Safety   | Can users get hurt?  | Losses, mistakes      |
| Trust    | Who can intervene?   | Rug pulls, censorship |

Each failure is different.
Each needs a different response.

---

## Real Examples (No Names, Just Logic)

- A protocol can be:

  - **Secure** (no exploits),
  - **Unsafe** (users lose money),
  - **Trusted** (admins exist).

- Another can be:
  - **Secure**,
  - **Safe**,
  - **Low-trust**,
  - but hard to use.

None of these contradict each other.

---

## The Most Dangerous Lie

> “This is secure, so it’s safe.”

False.

Security protects rules.
Safety protects people.

They overlap, but they are not the same.

---

## The Deep Insight (Lock This)

> **Security protects the system.  
> Safety protects the user.  
> Trust defines who you depend on.**

A mature engineer evaluates all three — separately.

---

## Why Ethereum Is Often Misunderstood

Ethereum optimizes for:

- **security**
- **low trust**

It does **not** optimize for:

- safety
- user comfort
- error forgiveness

This is intentional.

Ethereum is a foundation.
Safety must be built on top.

---

## The Analogy (Final Lock)

### A Sharp Knife

- **Secure**: it won’t snap or malfunction
- **Unsafe**: it can cut you if mishandled
- **Trustless**: it doesn’t decide how you use it

The knife didn’t fail.
The user misunderstood the tool.

---

## Final Note

From today onward:

- stop asking “Is it secure?”
- ask **three questions instead**.

Security.  
Safety.  
Trust.

Seeing the difference is not pessimism.
It’s **clarity**.

**Now the ocean is yours.  
Dive in.**
