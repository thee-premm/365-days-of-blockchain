# DAY 35 — Trust Assumptions in Web3  
### *A Checklist Mindset for Seeing Reality Clearly*

---

## Gist
Web3 does not remove trust.  
It **moves and reshapes trust**.

The danger is not trust itself —
the danger is **unknown trust**.

DAY 35 is about learning how to *see* trust assumptions,
before they see you.

---

## First Principle: Trust Is Never Binary

Nothing is:
- fully trustless
- fully trusted

Every system lies on a **spectrum of trust assumptions**.

The skill is not avoiding trust.
The skill is **identifying exactly where trust lives**.

---

## Why This Matters More Than Technology

Most failures in Web3 happen because:
- users trusted the wrong component,
- developers misunderstood assumptions,
- systems were trusted beyond their guarantees.

Not because:
- cryptography broke,
- consensus failed,
- Ethereum collapsed.

Understanding trust assumptions is **defensive intelligence**.

---

## The Core Mental Shift

Stop asking:
> “Is this decentralized?”

Start asking:
> **“What must go right for this to be safe?”**

That single question reveals everything.

---

## The Trust Assumption Checklist

Use this checklist **every time** you look at a protocol, DAO, or app.

---

### 1️⃣ Who Can Change the Code?

Ask:
- Is the contract upgradeable?
- Who controls the upgrade keys?
- Is there a timelock?
- Can upgrades be rushed?

If code can change:
> You are trusting the upgrader.

---

### 2️⃣ Who Controls the Funds?

Ask:
- Are funds in a smart contract?
- Is there an admin withdrawal?
- Is there a multisig?
- How many signers exist?

If funds can be moved manually:
> You are trusting humans.

---

### 3️⃣ Who Controls the Frontend?

Ask:
- Is the UI hosted centrally?
- Can it be changed silently?
- Is there an alternative interface?

If the frontend lies:
> Users sign lies cryptographically.

---

### 4️⃣ Where Does the Data Come From?

Ask:
- Are prices from oracles?
- How many data sources?
- Can one actor manipulate inputs?

Bad data + correct execution = disaster.

---

### 5️⃣ What Happens When Things Go Wrong?

Ask:
- Is there a pause switch?
- Can the system halt?
- Can funds be frozen?
- Who decides emergencies?

Emergency controls = trust trade-offs.

---

### 6️⃣ What Is the Economic Assumption?

Ask:
- Who is incentivized to act honestly?
- What happens if incentives flip?
- What if price crashes suddenly?

Security that depends on price is **conditional security**.

---

### 7️⃣ Can You Exit Unilaterally?

Ask:
- Can you withdraw without permission?
- Is there a delay?
- Do you need cooperation?

If exit requires permission:
> You are trusting availability and goodwill.

---

## The Most Common Hidden Assumption

> “This has never failed before.”

Past survival is **not a guarantee**.
It is just historical luck.

---

## The Key Insight (Lock This)

> **Trust assumptions are not bad.  
Unexamined trust assumptions are.**

Web3 maturity is not cynicism.
It is clarity.

---

## Why This Mindset Is Powerful

With this checklist:
- hype loses power,
- fear loses power,
- marketing loses power.

You see systems as:
- sets of guarantees,
- sets of risks,
- sets of boundaries.

This is how auditors think.
This is how protocol designers think.
This is how long-term survivors think.

---

## The Analogy (Final Lock)

### Using Web3 Is Like Crossing Bridges

Some bridges are:
- concrete,
- tested,
- well-lit.

Some are:
- wooden,
- guarded by humans,
- repaired manually.

Both can work.

But only if:
> **You know what kind of bridge you’re stepping on.**

---

## Final Note

DAY 35 gives you a lens you’ll never lose.

From now on:
- you won’t ask “Is it safe?”
- you’ll ask **“Safe under what assumptions?”**

That question changes everything.

**Now the ocean is yours.  
Dive in.**
